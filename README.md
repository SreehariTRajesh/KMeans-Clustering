# KMeans-Clustering
<h1>K Means Clustering  Notebooks</h1>
<p>
K Means Clustering forms an essential Part of unsupervised machine learning 
<br>
Classifying Data into groups is an essential part of Human Intelligence 
<br>
For machines to perform classification of data we use K-Means Clustering algorithm
<br>
Dataset for the Same has been taken from Kaggle K-Means Clustering Datasets
